There are good grounds for taking the slowdown of Indian economic growth to be a cause for concern. Even though ‘dismal’ is hardly an apt description, it is right to think afresh about what can be done over time to remedy this comparative sluggishness. Economic growth is indeed important, not for itself, but for what it allows a country to do with the resources that are generated, expanding both individual incomes and the public revenue that can be used to meet social commitments. Had European countries gone for growth rather than ill- timed austerity at the height of a recession, the public revenue so generated would have helped them to put their public finances in order without massively compromising the great European commitment to provide essential public services, which has been an inspiration for other parts of the world – from Singapore to Brazil. India, like Europe, carries a sizeable deficit, but it has resolutely – and we believe rightly – not fallen for the siren call of immediate austerity, thereby keeping its economy expanding fast and its financial standing relatively high.2 In the long run, of course, India’s public finances need fixing, which it should be able to do, making use of the financial freedom that high growth yields. What is, however, important to recognize is that in India public services call for far- reaching expansion (as will be presently discussed), and it is also critical to raise the individual incomes of the poor. From both perspectives, maintaining a high- growth economy is an important objective, along with ensuring good use of the public revenue generated by economic growth. It is also essential, of course, to pay attention to the character of the growth process, including its equity and sustainability; we shall return to this presently.
